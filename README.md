# Animal Sound Detection

Assignment for the **Visualisation** Course at the **University of Birmingham**, MSc Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 2025

This project focuses on identifying different animal sounds in an audio file by analyzing its frequency spectrum. Design filters that isolate the sounds of three different animals based on their frequency ranges and generate spectrograms for each filtered signal.

## Methods:

1. **FFT and Inverse FFT**: Analyze a time series dataset using FFT and reconstruct it using inverse FFT.
2. **Filtering in the Frequency Domain**: Apply a frequency filter to isolate specific frequencies.
3. **Audio Signal Processing**: Load, analyze, and visualize audio data using spectrograms.
4. **Audio Filtering**: Isolate components of an audio signal by applying frequency-domain filters.

## Requirements:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `IPython`
- `pandas`

## Files Included
- **.wav files**: Audio samples to analyze.
- **Sound-Detection.ipynb**: the main notebook that performs all the analysis and visualizations.
